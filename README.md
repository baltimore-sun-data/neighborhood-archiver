# neighborhood-archiver
City agencies often use the "community statistical area" and "neighborhood statistical area" geographies to describe data. Since these CSAs and NSAs are proprietary, non-census geographies that appear to be unique to Maryland, we have in the past used the sheets from https://baltimore2006to2010acsprofiles.wordpress.com/ to give us demographic information for neighborhoods. We were worried about these files being removed, however, so we decided to archive them.

This script is based on a tool at https://gist.github.com/borpglass/f4a9e64938ec94959a04 that was originally written at home as a joke.
